# Introduction to styles

Visage uses CSS object styles as the source of styles for components with addition to something called [responsive CSS properties](#responsive-css-properties).

CSS object styles are just normal object literals like the following:

```js transpile=false
{
  fontSize: '14px',
  color: 'red',
  '&:hover': {
    color: 'blue',
  },
}
```

## Responsive CSS properties

Responsive CSS property is an ability to specify CSS property value as an array where each index has it's breakpoint that needs to be matched in order to output the value in generated styles.

Visage uses 3 breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop in [ResponsiveDesignSystem](/components/responsive-design-system) and is **mobile-first**.

Let's talk about the following use case: you want to change styles of component on different devices. In CSS you would use [CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) to achieve that.

```js transpile=false
{
  // mobile
  fontSize: '12px',
  color: 'red',
  '&:hover': {
    color: 'blue',
  },
  ['@media (screen and (min-width: 40.0625em)']: {
    // tablet
    fontSize: '14px',
  },
  ['@media (screen and (min-width: 64.036em)']: {
    // desktop
    fontSize: '16px',
  },
}
```

Now we can see that fontSize is different for each device, we can use responsive CSS property for this.

```js transpile=false
{
  fontSize: ['12px', '14px', '16px'],
  color: 'red',
  '&:hover': {
    color: 'blue',
  },
}
```

As you can see the CSS properties accept arrays where each position has it's matching device in the following order: mobile, tablet, desktop. If you don't use an array as a value then the value is used by all breakpoints.

### Advanced usage

#### Turn off CSS property

If you pass `null` as a value of CSS property then it's ignored and doesn't produce any style.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: null, // font size is ignored
}
```

#### Turn off css property for given device

If you pass `null` as a value of responsive CSS property then it's ignored and doesn't produce any style.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: ['12px', null, '16px'], // font size is ignored on tablet
}
```

#### Inherit value from previous breakpoint

If you want to avoid repetition in responsive CSS properties and take the value from previous breakpoint, use `undefined` in place of a value.

```js transpile=false
{
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: ['12px', undefined, '16px'], // is the same as ['12px', '12px', '16px']
}
```

⚠️ Don't use `undefined` as first value in an array because it'll turn off the property for mobile.
